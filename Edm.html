        <h1>EDM - Electronic Dance Music</h1>
        <p>
          Electronic dance music, commonly known by the acronym EDM, is an
          umbrella term for various percussive electronic music genres.<br />
          All EDM is created through a combination of digital and analog
          equipment, including synthesizers, drum machines, and samples of
          previous recordings. EDM typically features strong, rhythmic
          percussion, which has made it an ideal soundtrack for dancefloors.
          However, in recent years, EDM DJs or artists have also been staples of
          large-scale performances, such as music festivals.<br />
          EDM remained an underground genre of music for several decades until
          Madonna’s Ray of Light (1998) album and tracks by EDM artists like
          Steve Aoki, Martin Garrix, David Guetta, Tiesto, and Daft Punk made
          their way onto the American and European pop music charts. They and
          other EDM artists like Deadmau5 and Skrillex have transitioned the
          genre into the mainstream music industry. Major pop acts like Justin
          Bieber and Coldplay have recorded tracks with EDM artists and
          producers.

            Since its inception, EDM has gone from being the centerpiece of the
            raves in the desert or abandoned warehouses to becoming a
            significant attraction on the music festival circuit. In many ways,
            it has supplanted the traditional music genres that perform at large
            outdoor concert venues, like rock and roll and country, both of
            which were forced to scale back their efforts in the 2000s.

          <div class="description">
            <p>
              EDM festivals have proven to be major money-makers for both
              artists and their host cities; a single 2015 EDM festival in Las
              Vegas brought more than $350 million in revenue to Clark County,
              Nevada. EDM festivals have attracted such high ticket sales and
              attendee numbers that music festivals that aren’t entirely focused
              on the genre, like Coachella, have added EDM artists to their
              roster.

            <p>
              The roots of EDM can be traced to a diverse array of musical
              genres during the late 1960s and 1970s, i ncluding the icy
              electro-pop of German EDM pioneers Kraftwerk, the hypnotic grooves
              of Italian music producer Giorgio Moroder, the complex turntable
              work in hip-hop, and the psychedelic cut-and-paste of Jamaica’s
              dub music scene. These electronic sounds made their way into
              disco, the club music of its day.

            <h3>RISE OF SUBGENRES</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Disco would influence New Wave music known through synthpop or
              techno-pop, which emphasized electronic beats and heavy melodic
              synthesizers. Their rise was met with a host of subgenres like
              techno, house, and acid house, all anchored by a 4/4 beat from the
              Roland TR-808 drum machine. Meanwhile, electro, Chicago house, and
              deep house folded funk, soul, and analog instruments into the
              post-disco sound.

            <p>
              Techno, which DJs wielded to keep dancefloors moving over marathon
              periods of time, splintered into different microgenres like
              Detroit house and trance. Countering its dreamline tempo was the
              UK’s hardcore rave, which added greater beats per minute (BPM) and
              breakbeats; it, too, produced numerous offshoots like drum and
              bass and UK garage, which itself launched the bass-heavy dubstep
              genre.

            <h3>ENTERING THE MAINSTREAM</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
              By the new millennium, EDM had entered the mainstream, and with it
              ushered in all-new sounds. House re-emerged as electro house,
              while trap music rose from Southern hip-hop. Electroclash and
              hardstyle pulled from New Wave and hardcore to forge their own
              musical identities.

          </div>

          <p>
            Emerging from Chicago’s club music scene, house music was a largely
            instrumental sound that featured repetitive disco rhythm with
            percussion crafted on a drum machine and various percussive
            instruments for a Latin or soul feel. One of its many subgenres,
            acid house, featured altered drums with a distinct “squelching”
            sound. Frankie Knuckles and other Chicago-area DJs are credited with
            launching house.

          </div>

          <p>
            Early electronica artists like Giorgio Moroder and Kraftwerk were
            pioneers of techno music’s continuous, otherworldly sound, driven by
            a repetitive, common beat under synthesizers and other electronic
            gear. Its sound evolved almost constantly during the 1980s and
            1990s, sprouting offshoots in Chicago, Detroit, London, and Germany;
            early media coverage of EDM used “techno” as a catch-all term for
            the music scene.

          <p>
            As the name suggests, trance music is intended to put the dancer
            into a trance-like state of consciousness. Producers typically build
            trance tracks around a single chord, melodic variations, and layered
            glimmers of sounds, including vocals and percussion. It’s one of the
            few EDM genres that stands up to listening when you’re off the dance
            floor. Its major artists include DJ Armin van Buuren, Paul Van Dyk,
            Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, and John Digweed.
